.. _getting started:

===============
Getting started
===============

Make sure you have :ref:`installed pyDVL <pyDVL Installation>` before proceeding
further.


Running the examples
====================

Start by browsing our worked-out examples illustrating pyDVL's capabilities
either:

- :ref:`In this documentation<examples>`.
- Using `binder <https://mybinder.org/>`_ notebooks, deployed from each
  example's page.
- Locally, by starting a jupyter server at the root of the project. You will
  have to install jupyter first manually since it's not a dependency of the
  library.

Using the library
=================

pyDVL offers algorithms for data valuation and computation of influence
functions. You can read more about each here:

- :ref:`data valuation`.
- :ref:`influence`.


What's next
===========

You should go to the :ref:`Examples <examples>` section of the documentation
to see more detailed usage of the library.

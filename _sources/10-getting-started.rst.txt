Getting started
===============

Make sure you have :ref:`installed pyDVL <pyDVL Installation>` before proceeding
further.

.. note::
   We provide minimal overviews of key concepts in :ref:`data valuation` and
   :ref:`influence`. For an in-depth survey of the field, we refer to the review on
   the topic at the :tfl:`TransferLab website <>`.

Running the examples
====================

If you are somewhat familiar with the concepts of data valuation, you can start
by browsing our worked-out examples illustrating pyDVL's capabilities either:

- :ref:`In this documentation<examples>`.
- Using `binder <https://mybinder.org/>`_ notebooks, deployed from each
  example's page.
- Locally, by starting a jupyter server at the root of the project. You will
  have to install jupyter first manually since it's not a dependency of the
  library.

Methods covered
===============

pyDVL offers algorithms for data valuation and computation of influence
functions. You can read more about each family of methods here:

- :ref:`data valuation`.
- :ref:`influence`.
